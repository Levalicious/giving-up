This is a cryptocurrency I am working on. 

It is, effectively, some sort of unholy abomination made by combining an IOTA style DAG and a blockchain.

Implement Ethereum-style transactions

Implement dPoS Consensus protocol

Implement Ethereum's smart contract VM system

Planned features, as well as progress updates, will be on the following Trello board:
